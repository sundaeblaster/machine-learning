# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field in artifical intelligence that deals with the use of data, algorithms, and models which help computers solve complex problems. The use of machine learning is particularly helpful in finding relationships in data, often quicker than a human.

## Setup

To begin machine learning it is vital to have the following:
- Math skills (algebra, statistics, etc.)
- Basic Python programming skills (functions, loops, datatypes, etc.)
- Access to an IDE or notebook (VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebook)
- Essential python libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.)
